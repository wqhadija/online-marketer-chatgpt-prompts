## As a Novel Writer ✍🏻

### 1. Write a Best Novel 📚
For example, you could give the following input:
> Develop a plot for a mystery novel about a detective who is called to investigate a suspicious death at a wealthy estate. The detective must navigate a web of clues and red herrings to uncover the truth and solve the case, leading to a twist ending that no one saw coming.

This input includes several keywords related to mystery and crime, as well as specific elements that are commonly found in mystery novels, such as a detective, clues, and a twist ending. GPT-3 can then use this input to generate ideas and text that could form the basis for a compelling mystery novel.

### 2. One Novel Outline Whole Picture of The Story 🌃
You could provide the following input: 
> Write an outline for a short, one-page novel that includes a compelling plot, well-developed characters, and a satisfying ending. The novel should be engaging and leave a lasting impression on the reader.

This input provides GPT-3 with some general guidelines for what you are looking for in a one-page novel. You could also include specific keywords related to the genre or theme that you are interested in, such as "mystery," "romance," or "science fiction."

Keep in mind that a one-page novel will be quite short and will need to be highly condensed in order to include all of the necessary elements. Therefore, it will be important to focus on the most important plot points and characters and to leave out any unnecessary details. GPT-3 can help generate ideas and text for the outline, but it will be up to you to craft a concise and compelling story that fits within the one-page format.

### 3. Write a Great Complete Novel 📗

You could provide the following input: 
> Write a novel with a compelling plot, well-developed characters, and a satisfying ending. The novel should be [insert desired length] and should explore [insert theme or genre]. It should be engaging and leave a lasting impression on the reader.

This input provides GPT-3 with some general guidelines for what you are looking for in a novel. You can specify the desired length of the novel (e.g., "50,000 words") and the theme or genre that you are interested in (e.g., "mystery," "romance," "science fiction").

Keep in mind that writing a complete novel is a significant undertaking that requires a lot of time, effort, and creativity. GPT-3 can help generate ideas and text for your novel, but it will be up to you to develop and refine those ideas into a cohesive and well-written story. It will also be important to carefully edit and revise your novel to ensure that it is of high quality and ready for publication.

### 4. Write a Good Chat Story 💬
You could provide the following input: 
>Write a chat story that includes a compelling plot, well-developed characters, and a satisfying ending. The chat story should be [insert desired length] and should explore [insert theme or genre]. It should be engaging and leave a lasting impression on the reader.

This input provides GPT-3 with some general guidelines for what you are looking for in a chat story. You can specify the desired length of the story (e.g., "5,000 words") and the theme or genre that you are interested in (e.g., "mystery," "romance," "horror").

Keep in mind that writing a complete chat story is a significant undertaking that requires a lot of time, effort, and creativity. GPT-3 can help generate ideas and text for your chat story, but it will be up to you to develop and refine those ideas into a cohesive and well-written story. It will also be important to carefully edit and revise your chat story to ensure that it is of high quality and ready for publication.

### 4. Write a Great Short Story 👩🏻‍🏫
Input that you could use to generate a great short story:
> Write a short story about a young woman who discovers a mysterious object that grants her the ability to communicate with animals. The story should be 1,500 words and should explore themes of compassion, responsibility, and self-discovery.
The main character, Sarah, is walking through the park one day when she comes across a strange, glowing stone. As she picks it up, she suddenly hears the thoughts of a nearby bird. Sarah is shocked, but also intrigued by this new power.
As she continues to experiment with the stone, Sarah discovers that she can communicate with all kinds of animals - from squirrels to dogs to rabbits. She finds that she has a natural affinity for understanding and helping them, and begins to use her new power to improve their lives.
However, Sarah soon realizes that this power comes with great responsibility. She must keep her ability a secret and use it wisely, as she fears that others might misuse or exploit it.
As Sarah grapples with these challenges, she also learns more about herself and her own desires. She begins to see the world in a new light and discovers that she has a passion for animal welfare.
The story should have a satisfying ending that ties all of the threads together and leaves a lasting impression on the reader. Sarah should come to a deeper understanding of herself and her place in the world, and find a way to use her power for good.

This input provides GPT-3 with a specific theme and genre for the short story, as well as specific elements that should be included (such as a main character with the ability to communicate with animals and a focus on compassion, responsibility, and self-discovery). It also includes details about the length of the story and the type of ending that you are looking for. GPT-3 can use this input to generate ideas and text for the short story, but it will be up to you to develop and refine those ideas into a cohesive and well-written story.

### 5. Write a Plot for Mystery Novel 🕵🏻
You could give the following input: 
> Develop a plot for a mystery novel about a detective who is called to investigate a suspicious death at a wealthy estate. The detective must navigate a web of clues and red herrings to uncover the truth and solve the case, leading to a twist ending that no one saw coming.

This input includes several keywords related to mystery and crime, as well as specific elements that are commonly found in mystery novels, such as a detective, clues, and a twist ending.

You might provide the following input:
> Create a funny single panel comic 

## As a Poet 🦋
You might provide the following input:
> Write a poem about [the ocean]
Include the phrase "[deep and vast]"

Once you have your input ready, you can use the OpenAI API to send a request to GPT-3 and generate your poem. The API will return the generated text to you, which you can then use as a starting point for your poem.

From there, you can edit and revise the generated text as needed to create a compelling poem. This may involve adding or removing lines, rearranging the order of the lines, or making other changes to the text to improve its flow and rhyme.

Finally, be sure to proofread and revise your poem carefully to ensure that it is error-free and reads well. With a little effort and creativity, you can use GPT-3 to create a beautiful and meaningful poem.
